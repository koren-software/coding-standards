# VSCode settings

These are recommended settings for code formatting if you are using Visual Studio Code editor. You can copy-paste these into project specific or global `settings.json`.

To make these settings work you should install following extensions:

- [Prettier - Code formatter](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) (by Prettier)
- [php cs fixer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=junstyle.php-cs-fixer) (by junstyle)

These settings will automatically format your code on save to follow our standards. You should have standards configuration files in place.
Any problems found will be viewable under "Problems" tab in VS Code.
